The directories are
-------------------
- corpus, text samples (text files) from a few languages used to train the program
- lang, languages that the program knows of (as serialized Java objects = binary files)
- test, text samples of "unknown" languages. For the program to classify which languages.

Some tips
---------
When copying text from web (wikipedia language editions)
you possibly will get very long lines. To format to some fixed width, use unix
command fold. Example;

$ fold french1.txt -s -w 40 > french2.txt

To check letter frequencies for different languages, see.
